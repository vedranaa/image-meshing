# image-meshing

*Contour-based meshing of the image domain developed for CINEMAX summer school.*

The module 'meshing.py' contains the functionality for contour-based meshing of the image. Contour detection uses marching squares implementation from the scikit image module, [skimage.measure.find_contours](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html#skimage.measure.find_contours).
